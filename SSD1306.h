/*
Set Display Offset (D3h)
This is a double byte command. The second command specifies the mapping of the display start line to one of
COM0~COM63 (assuming that COM0 is the display start line then the display start line register is equal to 0).
For example, to move the COM16 towards the COM0 direction by 16 lines the 6-bit data in the second byte
should be given as 010000b. To move in the opposite direction by 16 lines the 6-bit data should be given by
64 â€“ 16, so the second byte would be 100000b. The following two tables (Table 10-1, Table 10-2) show the
example of setting the command C0h/C8h and D3h.

Set Display Start Line (40h~7Fh)
This command sets the Display Start Line register to determine starting address of display RAM, by selecting
a value from 0 to 63. With value equal to 0, RAM row 0 is mapped to COM0. With value equal to 1, RAM
row 1 is mapped to COM0 and so on.

/*
Set Memory Addressing Mode:
Two byte command, second byte sets addressing mode.

Horizontal addressing mode: 00xb
In horizontal addressing mode, after the display RAM is read/written, the column address pointer is increased
automatically by 1. If the column address pointer reaches column end address, the column address pointer is
reset to column start address and page address pointer is increased by 1. The sequence of movement of the
page and column address point for horizontal addressing mode is shown in Figure 10-3. When both column
and page address pointers reach the end address, the pointers are reset to column start address and page start
address 


Page addressing mode: 10xb
In page addressing mode, after the display RAM is read/written, the column address pointer is increased
automatically by 1. If the column address pointer reaches column end address, the column address pointer is
reset to column start address and page address pointer is not changed. Users have to set the new page and
column addresses in order to access the next page RAM content.

Vertical addressing mode: 01xb
In vertical addressing mode, after the display RAM is read/written, the page address pointer is increased
automatically by 1. If the page address pointer reaches the page end address, the page address pointer is reset
to page start address and column address pointer is increased by 1. The sequence of movement of the page
and column address point for vertical addressing mode is shown in Figure 10-4. When both column and page
address pointers reach the end address, the pointers are reset to column start address and page start address

Set Column Address (21h)
This triple byte command specifies column start address and end address of the display data RAM. This
command also sets the column address pointer to column start address. This pointer is used to define the
current read/write column address in graphic display data RAM. If horizontal address increment mode is
enabled by command 20h, after finishing read/write one column data, it is incremented automatically to the
next column address. Whenever the column address pointer finishes accessing the end column address, it is
reset back to start column address and the row address is incremented to the next row.

Set COM Output Scan Direction (C0h/C8h)
This command sets the scan direction of the COM output, allowing layout flexibility in the OLED module
design. Additionally, the display will show once this command is issued. For example, if this command is
sent during normal display then the graphic display will be vertically flipped immediately. Please refer to
Table 10-3 for details.
